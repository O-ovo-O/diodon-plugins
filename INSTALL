Build Diodon Sample Plugins
=======================

Diodon uses the WAF build system.

To build and install the sample Diodon plugins into your home directory
use these commands (no root needed):

    ./waf configure --libdir ~/.local/share/
    ./waf build
    ./waf install

For uninstalling type this:

    ./waf uninstall

If you want to make the plugins available for all users you can use the following:

    sudo ./waf configure
    ./waf build
    sudo ./waf install

And for uninstalling it again:

    sudo ./waf uninstall
